Data Modeling is the process of defining how data is stored and defining relationships that exist among differnet entities in your data

A proper data model has the following benefits:

1. Easier to manage your data
2. Makes queries more efficient
3. Uses less memory and CPU
4. Reduces Costs

The Document models accepts schemas but does not enforce them

Ways to model data:
Embedding and referencing

Data that is accessed together, shoudl be stored together

Common Relationships:

one to one - one entity in a dataset is connected to one other entity in a dataset 
one to many - A relationship where a data entity in one set is connected to any number of data entities in another set
many to many - A relationship where any number of entities in one set are connected to any number of data entities in another set


Embedding:
 We take related data and inset it into our Document
Referencing:
 We Refer to documents in another collection in our document
