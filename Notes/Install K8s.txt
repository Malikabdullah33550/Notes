First create 3 VM's or 3 Containers

I am using containers coz i am a fool

now to install kubeadm go to
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/

and then go into installing a container runtime, or simple go to 

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#containerd

now first enable IPv4 packet forwarding from the page using the text given there, i am giving the text here just for the sake of context:




# sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF

# Apply sysctl params without reboot
sudo sysctl --system





now verify that net.ipv4.ip_forward is set to 1 with the command:

sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

If the output is 1, IPv4 configuration has been successfull
No click on the container runtime and click on containerd 
now you are at the step of the installation of containerd click on getting started with containerd
select ubuntu installation there and you go to the installation methods and install using repository

set up the repo for containerd
