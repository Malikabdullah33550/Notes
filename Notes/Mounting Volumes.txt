lsblk

2-  If Hdd has unallocated space, use the following process; if not, skip these steps
2.1- select the Hdd
sudo fdisk /dev/sdx  (Assume that sdx is your HDD)
2.2- format the disk
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxy (Assume sdxy is your desired partition and volume level)

3- create a directory for your HDD where you will store all of your data for the HDD (creating a mount point)
sudo mkdir /mnt/myHdd

4- mount the Hdd using:
sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/myHdd

5- For Auto Mounting of a device, on boot, do the following config:
5.1- Open /etc/fstab using nano editor and add the following line at the end of the file:
